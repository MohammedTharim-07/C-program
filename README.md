## Project 1: Seatbelt Indicator System

### Description
This project simulates an automotive seatbelt indicator system using Embedded C.

### Functionality
- Reads seatbelt status
- Turns LED ON if seatbelt is ON
- Turns LED OFF if seatbelt is OFF

### Concepts Used
- Embedded C programming
- Conditional statements
- Function usage
- Automotive ECU logic

### File
- seatbelt_indicator.c

### Output
Seatbelt LED ON  
or  
Seatbelt LED OFF  

### Future Improvements
- GPIO integration
- Microcontroller implementation
- AUTOSAR integration
